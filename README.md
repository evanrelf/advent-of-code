## Running

With [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) installed, just run the file like so:

```text
./2018/1.hs < input.txt
```

## Disclaimer

This is not a good place to look if you want examples of good, idiomatic,
well-thought-through Haskell code! I'm not always using the best tool for the
job in each exercise, in an effort to learn new things. Also there's a lot of
puzzles to get through so I'm usually sticking with the first working solution I
come up with, even when it's ugly...
